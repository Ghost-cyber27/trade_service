# Trade Service
Trade Service mobile application is a software that helps clients in finding the location of the nearest service they seek using Geo-location and the skilled worker's contact information. Trade service mobile application which focuses more on skilled trades is a mobile application that collects Geo-location data to be displayed on a map using google maps and also collects personal information such as name, phone number , email. This application eliminates the traditional method of employing a skilled worker through referrals from known associates.
